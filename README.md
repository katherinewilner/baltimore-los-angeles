# Baltimore and Los Angeles
##In this project, I analyzed the differences in rent between Baltimore City and Los Angeles City. 
###The first step to figuring out this data was to download data that included rent prices in various parts of each city. Both cities, I found, have a vast range of rent prices. The cheapest rent for Baltimore was reported as $265 per month. The most expensive rent was $1984.
###In Los Angeles, the cheapest rent was $879.75 and the most expensive was $2820 per month.
