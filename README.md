# Baltimore and Los Angeles
## In this project, I analyzed the differences in rent between Baltimore City and Los Angeles City. 
### I wanted to look into rent prices because I know that affordable housing in Los Angeles, and the state of California in general, has been an ongoing crisis. Because of the increasing population in the city and gentrification of various neighborhoods, paying rent can be an overwhelming burden for some people. Although the state has mandated cities to comply with affordable housing legislation, many claim that this is ineffective. I thought it would be interesting to see if rent in Baltimore, which also has housing problems, including building decay as well as unaffordable housing, was different from Los Angeles both in price and number of affordable areas.
#### The first step to figuring out this data was to download data that included rent prices in various parts of each city. Both cities, I found, have a vast range of rent prices. The cheapest rent for Baltimore was reported as $265 per month. The most expensive rent was $1984. On average, rent was $1046.88. In Los Angeles, the cheapest rent was $879.75 and the most expensive was $2820 per month. The average rent was $1361.
#### One major difference between Los Angeles and Baltimore, aside from Los Angeles having a higher rent on average, was the rate at which rent increased. Rent in Los Angeles increased at a much more constant rate, whereas Baltimore rent seems to flatline at around $1000 per month. 
#### In addition to looking into rent prices, I found it important to see what respective cities found to be a livable wage. On the Baltimore City Government website, minimum wage was reported at $10.10 per hour. In Los Angeles, it is $15.00 per hour. Despite these wages going up, rent can still be unaffordable, especially considering outside factors (i.e. single income, large family, illness).
#### The charts below demonstrate the different rates city rent increased in price.

#### These graphics and data were obtained through https://opportunityatlas.org/. In order to sort the data, I downloaded data sets including average rent prices from every tract in the country. To sort out rent prices for Los Angeles and Baltimore, I created two pivot tables, one that only included rent prices with the information "Los Angeles, CA" in it, and the other with only information from "Baltimore, MD". After, I scaled the two charts to have equal axis so data would not be skewed when being analyzed.
