# Baltimore and Los Angeles
## In this project, I analyzed the differences in rent between Baltimore City and Los Angeles City. 
### I wanted to analyze rent prices because affordable housing in Los Angeles has been an ongoing crisis. Because of the increasing population in the city and gentrification of various neighborhoods, paying rent can be an overwhelming burden for some people. I thought it would be interesting to see if rent in Baltimore, which also has housing problems (notably building decay as well as unaffordable housing) was different from Los Angeles in price and number of affordable areas.
### The first step to figuring out this data was to download data that included rent prices in various parts of each city. Both cities, I found, have a vast range of rent prices. The cheapest rent for Baltimore was reported as $265 per month. The most expensive rent was $1984.
### In Los Angeles, the cheapest rent was $879.75 and the most expensive was $2820 per month. One major difference between Los Angeles and Baltimore, aside from Los Angeles having a higher rent on average, was the rate at which rent increased. Rent in Los Angeles increased at a much more constant rate, whereas Baltimore rent seems to flatline at around $1000 per month.
### The charts below demonstrates the different rates city rent increased in price.
