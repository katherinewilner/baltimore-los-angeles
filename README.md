# Baltimore and Los Angeles
## In this project, I analyzed the differences in rent between Baltimore City and Los Angeles City. 
### The first step to figuring out this data was to download data that included rent prices in various parts of each city. Both cities, I found, have a vast range of rent prices. The cheapest rent for Baltimore was reported as $265 per month. The most expensive rent was $1984.
### In Los Angeles, the cheapest rent was $879.75 and the most expensive was $2820 per month. One major difference between Los Angeles and Baltimore, aside from Los Angeles having a higher rent on average, was the rate at which rent increased. Rent in Los Angeles increased at a much more constant rate, whereas Baltimore rent seems to flatline at around $1000 per month.
### The charts below demonstrates the different rates city rent increased in price.
